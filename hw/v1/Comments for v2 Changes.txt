## Schematic ## 
- Put some effort into the Title Block info.

## Component Changes ##
- C1: was a pain to install. Consider moving to a through-hole part instead.
- D1: consider increasing to a larger, higher-wattage part. 
- L1: also a pain to install. Consider moving to a through-hole part instead.


## Component Footprint Adjustments ##
- BZ1: holes too far apart for selected component; either look at moving them
  in, or find an alternate part that can use the footprint. 
- C3-C4: change from 1210-size footprint to 1206. 
- SW1: holes too small; had to file down the connector's pins to make them fit. 
  Increase the hole sizes.
- X1: pads are tucked immediately under the part, hard to solder by hand. Expand
  them out past the component body a bit. Consider adding a silkscreen outline
  while at it. 

  
## Layout Comments ##
- J1 (Power): add a polarity symbol (center positive) for ease of use. 
- J2 (USB): can be moved to the right to make room for a larger TVS diode (D1).
- U4 (MCU): two vias underneath (near C17) could use masking.
