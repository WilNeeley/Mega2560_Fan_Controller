## Schematic ## 
- Put some effort into the Title Block info.
- Trigger inputs: consider adding a single, high-impedance connection to the
  rest of the board (e.g. through a resistor + varistor) in case there's an ESD 
  event or something.
- Add LEDs for "+5", "5V_USB", and "VCC" power rails

## Component Changes ##
- C1: was a pain to install. Consider moving to a through-hole part instead.
- D1: consider increasing to a larger, higher-wattage part. 
- L1: also a pain to install. Consider moving to a through-hole part instead.
- LEDs: up the ballast resistor values to cut down the brightness.

## Component Footprint Adjustments ##
- BZ1: holes too far apart for selected component; either look at moving them
  in, or find an alternate part that can use the footprint. 
- C3-C4: change from 1210-size footprint to 1206. 
- SW1: holes too small; had to file down the connector's pins to make them fit. 
  Increase the hole sizes.
- X1: pads are tucked immediately under the part, hard to solder by hand. Expand
  them out past the component body a bit. Consider adding a silkscreen outline
  while at it. 

  
## Layout Comments ##
- FS1 (Power Fuse): Rotate 180 degrees so the side tied to the barrel connector
  is facing out. This lets you easily clamp onto it with an alligator clip
  to apply power without bypassing the fuse. 
- J1 (Power): add a polarity symbol (center positive) for ease of use. 
- J2 (USB): can be moved to the right to make room for a larger TVS diode (D1).
- J5 (AVR header): add pin labels for diagnostic help
- SW1: add ON/OFF labels
- U3 (FTDI): Add a Pin 1 indicator out from underneath the part.
- U4 (MCU): 
	- two vias underneath (near C17) could use masking. 
	- Add a Pin 1 indicator out from underneath the part.
